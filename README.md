# discord-input-stats-rpc
This small module written in C# tracks the amount of times you've pressed a key on your keyboard and the amount of left clicks on your mouse and displays them in your Discord RPC! 

- Trace amounts of CPU usage (&lt;1% occasionally) and memory (~7mb 64-bit, ~3mb 32-bit)
- Key contents are not logged
- Bundled into `.exe` for easier use
- Small hidden easter eggs in big and small image text:) (you can change them if you don't like them)
