# discord-input-stats-rpc
This small module written in C# tracks the amount of times you've pressed a key on your keyboard and the amount of left clicks on your mouse and displays them in your Discord RPC! 

- Trace amounts of CPU usage (&lt;1%) and memory (~??mb)
- Key contents are not logged
- Bundled into `.exe` for easier use
- Small hidden easter eggs in big and small image text:) (you can change them if you don't like them)

# How to manually setup (not recommended)
- Clone this repository in Visual Studio
- Install all required packages and run

**Only windows is supported at this time.**
