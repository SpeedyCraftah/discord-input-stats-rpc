# discord-input-stats-rpc
This small module written in python tracks the amount of times you've pressed a key on your keyboard and the amount of left clicks on your mouse and displays them in your Discord RPC! 

- Trace amounts of CPU usage (&lt;1%) and memory (~30mb)
- Key contents are not logged
- Also bundled into `.exe` for easier use
- Small hidden easter eggs in big and small image text:) (you can change them if you don't like them)

# How to manually setup
- Clone this repository into a folder
- Install all packages in `requirements.txt` (I recommend making a virtual env first with `py -m venv env` and `./env/Scripts/activate`)
- If you want to run in compact mode, open `main.py` and change the first variable to `True`
- Run `main.py`

**Only windows is supported at this time.**
